## Description
This is my version of a popular Wordle game. The rules are simple. You have to guess a 5-letter word, and you are given 6 attempts to do that. After each attempt, you will receive hints:
* If a letter is in the right position, it will light up green.\

* If a letter is in the word, but at a different position, it will light up yellow.\

* If a letter is not in the word, it will be colored gray.\

  pip install pygame
  ```
* Clone the repository and open the folder.
* Run the main file:
  ```
  python3 main.py
  ```
* Use keyboard or on-screen controls to enter letters.
* Have fun!
